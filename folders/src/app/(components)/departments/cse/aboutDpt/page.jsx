        The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Mahamaya College of Agricultural Engineering & Technology was established under the umbrella of the Department of Basic Engineering & Applied Sciences. Since the academic year 2008â€“09, the CSE program has been a core part of the undergraduate curriculum, offering a strong foundation in computational theory, programming, systems design, and data handling. The department is committed to providing high-quality education through a blend of theoretical concepts and hands-on experience. It is equipped with modern computer laboratories and infrastructure that support practical training, software development, research, and project-based learning. The CSE section focuses on developing problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and innovation among students, preparing them for successful careers in the IT industry, academia, and research. It regularly organizes workshops, seminars, and coding sessions to promote a culture of continuous learning and growth in emerging areas like AI, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Data Science.
