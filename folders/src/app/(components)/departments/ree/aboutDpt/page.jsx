        The Department of Renewable Energy Engineering was established in the year 2016 at the college with a holistic vision of integrating **Teaching, Research, and Extension** in the field of renewable energy, recognizing its vital role in shaping the future of **energy, ecology, and the environment**. Since its inception, the department has been actively engaged in imparting quality education to both undergraduate and postgraduate students of Agricultural Engineering, with a focus on Renewable Energy. The department emphasizes hands-on learning and applied research in areas such as **solar energy, biogas production, biomass gasification, slurry management, and biomass cultivation**, ensuring students gain real-world insights into sustainable technologies. In 2023, the department launched its **M.Tech program**, further strengthening its academic framework and research capabilities. Through various village-level extension activities, the department has played a key role in spreading awareness and demonstrating the practical applications of renewable energy technologies. It aims to promote rural development by encouraging the **recycling of locally available organic waste** for energy production and organic manure. The department is committed to conducting research projects with practical outcomes that directly benefit farmersâ€”such as **solar drying techniques, and converting crop residues into useful fuel forms**. Additionally, the department strives to **generate rural employment opportunities** by offering training programs that empower individuals towards **self-employment** in the renewable energy sector. Overall, the department envisions becoming a center of excellence by nurturing innovation, sustainability, and energy security through education and research.
